# Serverless Facial Recognition System using AWS

A fully serverless facial recognition system built on **AWS** that authenticates visitors by comparing their photos against a pre-registered employee database.  
The system uses **Amazon S3**, **AWS Lambda**, **Amazon Rekognition**, **Amazon DynamoDB**, and **Amazon API Gateway**, with a **React.js** frontend.

## ðŸ“Œ Architecture

![Architecture Diagram Placeholder](./images/architecture-diagram.png)

The system has two main flows:

1. **Admin Flow** â€“ Admin uploads employee photos to an S3 bucket, triggering a Lambda function that:
   - Extracts employee metadata from the filename (`FirstName_LastName.jpeg`)
   - Indexes the face into Amazon Rekognition
   - Stores FaceId and employee details into DynamoDB

2. **Visitor Flow** â€“ Visitors upload their photo via a React frontend, which:
   - Sends the image to S3 via API Gateway
   - Triggers a Lambda function to search for a match in Rekognition
   - Returns the employee details if matched
